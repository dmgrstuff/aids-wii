# aids-wii
prints "aids" in the console (it's just `printf` nothing special) - thanks [twosecslater](https://github.com/2secslater) for the idea

Pre-built binaries are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/dmgrstuff/aids-wii/releases).

## Compiling
Install devkitPro, `git clone` the repo, `cd` to the directory, and run `make`. That's pretty much it.
